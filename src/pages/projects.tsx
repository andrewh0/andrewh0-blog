        I paired with ChatGPT (GPT-4) on making a clone of one of my favorite
        childhood games, Tetris! It took some nudging and back and forth, but
        I&apos;m pretty pleased with how this turned out. I learned a lot about
        how Tetris is implemented and the subtle (but important!) differences
        between versions of the game.
