# Projects

## Personal Website v3 (2022)

The third major iteration of this website, updated with a new technology stack to support a personal blog.

_Stack_: React, Next.js, Theme UI, MDX, React Three Fiber, Three.js, TypeScript, Vercel

## Untitled Discord bot (2022)

I created a Discord bot for the server I hang out in with most of my close friends. It's highly specific to how we interact in the server and has references to inside jokes.

So far, it has a Message Command that helps people format text and a Slash Command that makes sharing gifs more convenient.

_Stack_: Node, discord.js, Airtable, Fly.io

## Digestif (2020)

Digestif shows me the most-liked Tweets from people I follow. It makes it easy to discover new Tweets or see what's going on at a glance.
It started as a web app hosted from my Raspberry Pi, accessible only on my home network.
Later, I built an integration that posts the best Tweets in Discord once a day.

_Stack_: Django, Celery, React, Next.js, Raspberry Pi

_External APIs_: Twitter, Discord

## OK.css (2020)

[Website](https://okcss.netlify.app/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/okcss)

OK.css is a classless CSS framework that adds sensible styling defaults to your web page. It's featured in [this collection](https://github.com/dohliam/dropin-minimal-css) of minimal stylesheets.

## Untitled Chinese Flashcard App (2020)

I've been learning Chinese, but wanted a more efficient way to review new vocabulary words.
I [shared a small prototype](https://twitter.com/andrewlho_codes/status/1279829618598412288) of what the frontend could look like in SwiftUI, and made some progress building a cross-platform client with React Native.
As part of this project, I also researched spaced-repetition algorithms and local-first apps.
I ultimately decided to put this project on hold when I discovered that the HSK exam would be updated with a new format and new vocabulary.

_Stack_: React Native, Expo, SwiftUI, sqlite

## YouTube Silence Skipper (2019)

[GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/youtube-skip-silence)

This is an experimental Chrome extension that shortens silences on YouTube, inspired by a similar feature in popular podcast apps.
It works by sampling the loudness of the video and increasing the playback rate when the loudness drops under a pre-defined threshold.

_Stack_: Chrome Extension, JavaScript

## Tech Talks (2019)

[Website](https://watchtechtalks.com) | [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/tech-talks)

Tech Talks was a place to discover and watch conference talks about web development.
I had collected thousands of talks from a number of JavaScript conferences from 2017 through 2019 by looking up their associated conference playlists on YouTube.
After maintaining it for a couple of years, I wasn't able to come up with a way to automate this reliably.
This project is no longer being actively developed.

_Stack_: React, Emotion, TypeScript, Firebase, Algolia, Heroku, Netlify

## Raspberry Pi Kiosk (2017)

[GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/kiosk)

The Raspberry Pi powers a display that shows the current time, news,
stocks, and weather. [I posted about it on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/andrewlho_codes/status/1068685640118689792)

_Stack_: React, Styled Components, TypeScript, Node, Express, Raspberry Pi

## Aurora (2017)

[Website](aurora-synth.now.sh) | [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/kiosk)

Aurora is web-based synth that can be played with a computer keyboard and MIDI keyboard (Chrome only).
It was inspired by professional software synths like Sylenth1, Massive, and Serum.
It is intended to be a way to explore audio synthesis in a way that is accessible and fun!

_Stack_: React, Redux, Styled Components, Web MIDI API, Tone.js, Flow

## LED Lamp (2015)

[Video](https://vimeo.com/113175895)

Inspired by the Philips Hue and the LIFX bulbs, I created a lighting solution that can be controlled by a web browser and can be customized with software.

I made a Wi-Fi connected RGB LED lamp out of a [Spark Core](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/discontinued/core-datasheet/), [IKEA Vidja lamp](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vidja-floor-lamp-with-led-bulb-white-30416149/), and [Neopixel light strip](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/).

_Stack_: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Python, Flask, Heroku, C++

## Algorithmic Music Generator (2012)

My first attempt at implementing a program that generates music was during my Computers and Music class I took in 2012.
I had been interested in algorithmic music composition for a while and I wanted the program to create something structured and pleasing to the ear.
This program is perfect for composers in need of a little inspiration, especially because there's a MIDI output for editing in DAWs (digital audio workstations).

_Stack_: Max MSP, JavaScript
