Sometimes I build things in my free time.

<ProjectTitle name="Personal Website v3" year={2022} />

The third major iteration of this website, updated with a new technology stack to support a personal blog.

<ProjectTitle name="Custom Discord bot" year={2022} />

I created a custom Discord bot for the private server I hang out in with some of my close friends. It's highly specific to how we interact in the server â€” mostly inside jokes and silly memes.

It's built with Discord's [Message Command](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#message-commands) and [Slash Command](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#slash-commands) APIs.

<ProjectTitle name="Digestif" year={2020} />

Digestif shows me the most-liked Tweets from people I follow. It makes it easy to discover new Tweets or see what's going on at a glance.
It started as a web app hosted from my Raspberry Pi, accessible only on my home network.
Later, I made it post the best Tweets to my Discord server once a day.

<ProjectTitle name="OK.css" year={2020} />

[Website](https://okcss.netlify.app/) &middot; [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/okcss)

OK.css is a classless CSS framework that adds sensible styling defaults to your web page. It's featured in [this collection](https://github.com/dohliam/dropin-minimal-css) of minimal stylesheets.

<ProjectTitle name="Chinese Flashcard App" year={2020} />

I've been learning Chinese, but wanted a more efficient way to review new vocabulary words.
I [shared a small prototype](https://twitter.com/andrewlho_codes/status/1279829618598412288) of what the frontend could look like in SwiftUI, and made some progress building a cross-platform client with React Native.
As part of this project, I also researched spaced-repetition algorithms and local-first apps.

<ProjectTitle name="YouTube Silence Skipper" year={2019} />

[GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/youtube-skip-silence)

This is an experimental Chrome extension that shortens silences on YouTube, inspired by a similar feature in popular podcast apps.
It works by sampling the loudness of the video and increasing the playback rate when the loudness drops under a pre-defined threshold.

<Stack technologies={["JavaScript", "Chrome Extension"]} />

<ProjectTitle name="Tech Talks" year={2019} />

[Website](https://watchtechtalks.com) &middot; [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/tech-talks)

Tech Talks was a place to discover and watch conference talks about web development.
I had collected thousands of talks from a number of JavaScript conferences from 2017 through 2019 by looking up their associated conference playlists on YouTube.
This project is no longer being actively developed.

<ProjectTitle name="Raspberry Pi Kiosk" year={2017} />

[GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/kiosk)

I connected my Raspberry Pi to a display that shows the current time, news, stocks, and weather.
Then I posted about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewlho_codes/status/1068685640118689792).

<ProjectTitle name="Aurora" year={2017} />

[Website](https://aurora-synth.vercel.app) &middot; [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewh0/kiosk)

Aurora is web-based synth that can be played with a computer keyboard and MIDI keyboard (Chrome only).
It was inspired by professional software synths like Sylenth1, Massive, and Serum.
I wanted to make exploring audio synthesis accessible and fun!

<ProjectTitle name="Wi-Fi LED Lamp" year={2015} />

[Video](https://vimeo.com/113175895)

Inspired by the Philips Hue and the LIFX bulbs, I created a lighting solution that can be controlled by a web browser and can be customized with software.

Made with [Spark Core](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/discontinued/core-datasheet/), [IKEA Vidja lamp](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vidja-floor-lamp-with-led-bulb-white-30416149/), and [Neopixel light strip](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/).

<ProjectTitle name="Algorithmic Music Generator" year={2012} />

For my final project in my Computers and Music class, I wrote a program that generates music based on user input (key, tempo, etc.) and rules from classical music theory.
