Hi, I’m Andrew. I’m a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Right now, I'm at [Landed](https://landed.com) helping essential professionals build financial security in the communities they serve.

---

I could not have arrived at where I am today without the support of other engineers, teachers, mentors, and the programming community, so my personal website is dedicated to sharing what I've learned so far — my knowledge, mistakes, and experiences — to help other people build something they're proud of.

This website is [open-source](https://github.com/andrewh0/andrewh0-blog) and so are many of my [projects](/projects). Feel free to email me with any questions or reach out elsewhere on the web.
