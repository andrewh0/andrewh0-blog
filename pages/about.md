Hi, I’m Andrew. I’m a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I enjoy bringing ideas to life by writing code.

Right now, I'm at [Landed](https://landed.com) helping essential professionals build financial security in the communities they serve.

You can [email me](mailto:hello@andrewho.me) for an updated resume.
